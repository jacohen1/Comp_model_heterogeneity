# Comp_model_heterogeneity

This folder contains all of the data and code necessary to undertake the analysis presented in https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.16.613211.

bipartite_parameter_data.csv contains the sigma and iota values for the two groups necessary for the bipartite heterogeneiety analyses. DD_solutions.nb and RD_solutions.nb are the files which then run the models using those sigma and iota values. r0_het_calc.R then takes the results from the models and calculates R0 and heterogeneity for each of the results.

The folder called "tripartite_heterogeneity" contains all the material necessary for the analyses presented in the SI.
